# DooDooWars
DooDooWars is a fast-paced, team-based game where players must eat to power up and "doo-doo" their way to victory! Each team starts with a set amount of points, and every time a player successfully "dunks" on the enemyâ€™s toilet with a kick, the opposing team loses points. The goal is to be the last team standing with points on the board.
