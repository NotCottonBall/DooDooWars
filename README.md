# DooDooWars
DooDooWars is a fast-paced, team-based game where players must eat to power up and "doo-doo" their way to victory! Each team starts with a set amount of points, and every time a player successfully "dunks" on the enemyâ€™s toilet with a kick, the opposing team loses points. The goal is to be the last team standing with points on the board.

# How To Clone And Run The Project
## Dependencies
- Unreal Engine 5 (VERSION 5.3.2)
- Plugins specified in `PluginsUsed.md` <i>(Required Only If You Wanna Build The Project)</i>
- If you want the cel-shaded art style, I used this from Unreal Engine's Marketplace:
    [Advanced Cel Shader Lite](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/ce2cda95e5f54180b2cf7df24566bdf7)

## Setup For Building The Project
If you wanna build and play this game then you need EOS setup in your project with the plugins mentioned.<br>
well i cant give you my API keys for EOS so you have to get your own. It's Free if you didnt know. <br>
you can find tutorials on youtube about how to setup EOS if this is your first time doing that.

That's it.<br>
If all you wanna do is to test the project and look at my <b><i>amazing</i></b> Blueprint Code then all you need to do is clone the project and run it in Unreal :) <br>

# The Game's Release
well, this game will probably come out a bit late because of how much time im giving it (really less). <br>
keep in mind that this is my first multiplayer game and first time using Unreal Engine so I'm also learning a lot of stuff about it. <br>

## Progress
Well right now i just need to add minor features like:
- Changing the color of the player's top according to which team the player is in.
And I need to fix a lot of stuff like:
- The audio not playing correctly in multiplayer.
- The Score not updating correctly. <br>
and some more.
